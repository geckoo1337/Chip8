Chip8

Another Chip8 emulator coded in C++ 17 with some roms.

As a graphical interface this emulator uses my Template - a Pixel Game Engine (available on GitHub too).

The first process reads in the folder all available roms - select one, play.

The best part was to interpret each OP. I wrote some explanations as comment in the code source ++
